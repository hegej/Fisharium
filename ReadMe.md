# Fisharium - ASCII Art Aquarium 🐟

**Fisharium** is a fun and interactive console application that simulates an aquarium using ASCII art. Colorful fish swim around, bubbles rise from the bottom, and plants sway gently in the water. This project creates a visual simulation of an aquarium using characters and colors in the console.

## Features 🎨 -Under work-

- 🐠 **Colorful fish**: Multiple different fish swim around the aquarium, each with its own unique appearance and color.
- 🐡 **Realistic swimming behavior**: Fish move horizontally and vertically, change direction when they hit the walls, and occasionally release bubbles.
- 🌱 **Swaying plants**: Plants along the bottom of the aquarium move gently from side to side, creating a dynamic and lively environment.
- 💨 **Bubbles**: As the fish swim, they occasionally release bubbles that rise through the water.
- 💻 **ASCII art and colors**: The entire aquarium is built using ASCII characters, and various colors are used to bring the fish, bubbles, and plants to life.

## Technology and Tools 🛠️

- **Language**: C# (console application)
- **Technology used**: .NET Core or .NET Framework to run the application in the console
- **ASCII Art**: Character-based images and representations for visual simulation
